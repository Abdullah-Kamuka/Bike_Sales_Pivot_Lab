# 🚲 Bike Sales Pivot Analysis Lab

Welcome to the **Bike Sales Pivot Lab**, a hands-on data analysis project designed to explore and summarize bike sales data using Excel pivot tables. This project is part of a broader learning journey in data analytics and business intelligence.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this lab is to analyze transactional bike sales data by creating dynamic pivot tables that reveal key insights such as:
